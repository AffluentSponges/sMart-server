      "description": "\n         \nI bought this from Verizon two years ago. I used it mainly for school purposes and the occasional iPad game. I picked up this Lifeproof case after about 6 months of using a case with a built-in keyboard. The Lifeproof case was $100 new, and it boasts of being able to protect from water damage, electrical damage, and screen damage from falls, drops, or tumbles. I'm doing a factory reset on the iPad, but I'm not sure if that unlocks it for other service providers. It has built in wireless capabilities as well as Wi-Fi. It is in perfect working condition; I just don't need it anymore.    "

The Lifeproof case was $100 new, and it boasts of being able to protect from water damage, electrical damage, and screen damage from falls, drops, or tumbles. I'm doing a factory reset on the iPad, but I'm not sure if that unlocks it for other service providers. It has built in wireless capabilities as well as Wi-Fi.
